# Friend-Finder
This application takes answers from a survey that the user takes and compares those answers to answers from other users.  The survey questions are set up in that the user selects 1 to 5 corresponding to how much they agree or disagree with the current question.  The application will then display the current user with a user that is the best match for them based on the results of the surveys.
